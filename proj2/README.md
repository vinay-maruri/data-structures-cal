In this project, my partner and I built a 1980s style video game that can be run from the command line. 
There is random world generation, and play is supported by keyboard and by inputting a string. 
My partner and I chose to build a pacman style game, where the game gets harder and harder (through addition of more enemies)
as the levels increase. The goal of the game is to get as high a score as possible.
