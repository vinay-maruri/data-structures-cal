In this project, I created a Google Map like application that supported turn by turn directions, search for features of interest, restaurants, 
and addresses in the East Bay area (we were limited by the availability of open-source map data). It features a map GUI interface, 
and works largely like Google Maps does. It computes the shortest route from one place to another, and gives turn by turn directions
to the end user.
